![Firewall Setup](https://i.imgur.com/Aa9PE1P.png) <!-- Placeholder image -->

## Introduction

In this project, we implemented the Sophos XGS 4300 Firewall to replace the existing firewall system. This involved comprehensive planning, installation, configuration, and testing to ensure that the new firewall met all security and performance requirements. The process is documented in detail below, including the technical evaluation, setup, quality assurance, and final results. Key phases include:

- Technical Evaluation of the Current System
- Setup of the New System
- Quality Assurance Before Implementation
- Commissioning the New System
- VPN Rollout and User Guide
- Quality Assurance After Implementation

## Technical Evaluation of the Current System

- Documenting Settings and Configurations: The existing firewall was fully documented (Excel) to ensure all important configurations could be transferred to the new firewall.
- Review of Security Settings and Rule Sets: Included all security-related configurations and specific rule sets.
- Decision on VPN Configuration: VPN configuration was decided in collaboration with the system administrator.

## Setup of the New System

- Hardware Installation: Physical installation of the new Sophos XGS 4300 Firewall, including cabling with RJ45 patch cables.
- Software Configuration: Transfer of relevant configurations from the old system (e.g., DHCP, DNS, VPN) and complete transfer of the rule set.
- Security Features: Implementation of Web Protection, Deep Packet Inspection, Intrusion Prevention, Quality of Service, and Malware Protection.
- Documentation of the Setup: All setup steps were documented to facilitate future maintenance and upgrades.

## Quality Assurance Before Implementation

Before implementing the new firewall, the following quality assurance steps were completed:

- Configuration Review: Comprehensive checks of network interfaces, rule sets, and configurations (DHCP, VPN, DNS) were conducted.
- Security Audits and Performance Checks: Detailed audits to ensure the system was ready for deployment.

## Commissioning the New System

- Transition to the New Firewall: Removed network cables from the old system and connected them to the new firewall.
- Functionality Testing: Final testing to ensure the firewall was functioning correctly and the network remained stable.
- System Monitoring: Short-term monitoring to confirm stability and performance.

## VPN Rollout and User Guide

- VPN Client Rollout: The VPN client was automatically installed on all target devices via Group Policies. Functionality was tested.
- User Guide Creation: A user-friendly guide was developed to assist employees in configuring and using the VPN client.

## Quality Assurance After Implementation

After implementing the new firewall, the following quality assurance steps were completed:

- Reliability Testing: Tests to evaluate network configurations, security features, and data transfer were conducted.
- Attack Simulations and Stress Tests: Simulations of realistic attacks and stress tests to ensure security and stability under real-world conditions.

## Conclusion

In this project, the Sophos XGS 4300 Firewall was successfully implemented, and detailed documentation was provided throughout the process. The implementation included thorough configuration, testing, and monitoring. The metrics show a significant reduction in security events and incidents after applying the new firewall, indicating its effectiveness. 

Note: If resources within the network were heavily used, there might be variations in the metrics. Further analysis may be required for different usage scenarios.
